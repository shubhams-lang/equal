# Ekpyrotic
> Real-time, mobile-optimized anonymous social networking web app with high-performance gaming modules.

## 🏗 Architecture & Core Logic
- **State Management**: Uses `ChatContext` as the single source of truth for global app state.
- **Networking**: Event-driven architecture powered by Socket.io.
- **Data Flow**: Optimistic Rendering (Local State Update -> Socket Emit -> Server Broadcast).

## 📜 Development Constraints
- **Interaction**: Use `onPointerDown` instead of `onClick` for game loops to eliminate mobile tap latency.
- **Haptics**: Every primary UI action must trigger `navigator.vibrate(n)`.
- **Viewport**: Game containers must use `touch-none` and `select-none` to prevent accidental browser scaling.
- **Hooks**: Wrap high-frequency functions in `useCallback`. Use `useRef` for non-rendering state (e.g., `isGameOver`).
- **Cleanup**: All `useEffect` hooks must unregister `socket.off` and clear intervals to prevent memory leaks.

## 📂 Core Modules & Files
- [/context](context.md): Global state initialization and socket setup.
- [/components/games](games.md): High-performance logic for SliderRace, TicTacToe, and TapTap.
- [/components/ui](ui.md): Atomic design system (Overlays, Badges, high-contrast typography).

## 📡 Key Socket Protocol
- `SLIDE_UPDATE`: Real-time position tracking for racing.
- `TTT_MOVE`: Grid-based turn updates.
- `REMATCH_OFFER`: Rematch flow logic (Request -> Received -> Accept -> Restart).

## 💡 Optional & Maintenance
- [/docs/changelog](changelog.md): History of architectural shifts.
- [/tests](tests.md): Unit tests for game logic and socket mocks.
