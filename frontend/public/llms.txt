# [Webapp Name] - Ekpyrotic
> A real-time, mobile-optimized anonymous social networking web app.

## Architecture
- **State**: Single source of truth via `ChatContext`. 
- **Communication**: Event-driven architecture using `socket.emit('game-data', {type, ...payload})`.
- **UI**: Atomic component structure with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Coding Rules
1. **Mobile-First Interaction**: 
   - Use `onPointerDown` instead of `onClick` for game actions to eliminate the 300ms mobile tap delay.
   - Apply `touch-none` and `select-none` to game containers to prevent accidental scrolling/zooming.
   - Always include `navigator.vibrate(n)` for primary action feedback.

2. **Synchronization**:
   - Perform "Optimistic Rendering" (update local state immediately) then broadcast via Socket.io.
   - Use `useRef` for values that change rapidly but shouldn't trigger a re-render (like `lastX` or `gameOverSent`).

3. **Performance**:
   - Cleanup all `setInterval` and `socket.off` listeners in the `useEffect` return block to prevent memory leaks.
   - Use `useCallback` for functions passed into `useEffect` dependencies.

4. **UI/UX Consistency**:
   - Rematch flow must always follow: `Request` -> `Received/Accept` -> `Restart`.
   - Victory/Defeat overlays must use backdrop-blur and high-contrast typography.

## Directory Structure
- `/context`: Global state and socket initialization.
- `/components/games`: Logic-heavy game modules (SliderRace, TicTacToe, TapTap).
- `/components/ui`: Reusable layout elements (Overlays, Buttons, Badges).

## Key Socket Types
- `SLIDE_UPDATE`: Real-time position tracking.
- `TTT_MOVE`: Grid-based state updates.
- `REMATCH_OFFER`: Signaling intent to play again.
